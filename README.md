# LicensePlateGame
The License Plate Game I thought up of is to take the three letters found on most license plates (e.g "HLO") then think of a word that contains those letters in that order. This program helps find words given letters using these rules.

/*
 * The License Plate Game is to use the three letters found on most license
 * plates and to think of a word that has those letters in the order found.
 * For example, "HLO 1234" could be "hello" because hello has h before l before
 * o! I started playing this game on the road and encountered letter that maybe
 * had no solution, so I made this to find solutions (or none) to hard letter
 * combinations.
 * 
 * Prompts user for three letter combination from license plate then searches
 * a comprehensive word list for a solution using the given rules and prints
 * all following words.
 * 
 * Word list has 466k English words (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
 * 
 * Just helped me find a word for "AMW" -> "flAMethroWer"
 * 
 * Runs fast!
